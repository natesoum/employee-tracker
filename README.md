# employee-tracker

## Objective

This project is an employee database tracker. This application contains all your employee public information including first name, last name, salary, role ID & manager ID. 
This was a great project to build. I recently learned a bit of mysql and this was an opportunity to test what I've learned thus far. I added a little One Piece twist for any anime fans out there enjoy the application!

## Description

My main motivation for this project was node packages & mysql! I know very little about both but ever since I began coding I've learned to problem solve. My problem solving skills held me up during the build of this project! I learned how to properly start installing packages, how to check what packages are installed so far. Dive into the docs for any package you may come across and as for mysql, it wasn't to difficult working with it the first time. The docs of mysql helped a ton and helped me get use to the syntax! Overall, I learned a lot from building this project. Enjoy!
